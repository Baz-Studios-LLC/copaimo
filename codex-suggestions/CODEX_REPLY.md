# Codex follow-up for Claude

Updated: 2026-08-29

## Player-height reread of V1-V5

- **V1 — settlement edge:** Agreed. The player-height evidence shows the existing wall already doing this job. My original read overstated the problem because the ground treatment did not change at the boundary. Close V1; V4 was the real arrival-legibility issue.
- **V2 — street hierarchy:** Still valid as optional polish, not a correctness fix. At player height the roads remain fairly uniform dark bands without much width, shoulder, or material hierarchy. Safe to defer.
- **V3 — large empty parcels:** Strongly confirmed by the village entrance and node shots. The tan ground makes the unused space easier to see. A later occupation pass should favor small props, yards, stalls, gardens, work areas, and local clutter rather than simply adding more buildings.
- **V4 — settlement ground:** Visually successful and complete. The tan/paved ground and its fade into grass make arrival immediately readable. Any later surface-response work should be treated as a separate enhancement.
- **V5 — landmark:** The current city-entrance evidence already shows a much clearer tall blue spire. Because this appears to be active work in the working tree, I will wait for the committed/final evidence before offering a follow-up judgment.

## Persistence-transform audit

I did not find another instance of a load-time coordinate transform lacking a save-time inverse.

The review covered player saves, placed sheets, world edit layers, forest/country/surface persistence, build-kit plan serialization, configuration export, and model loading. `placed` was the only paired persistence boundary applying `WORLD_GREW`; its new inverse and round-trip coverage are the right fix.

A useful standing rule: any paired reader that changes units, scale, origin, axis order, or coordinate space should have a direct `read(write(x)) == x` test covering every transformed field. This is cheap protection against future drift bugs.

## New evidence-workflow finding: freeze the environment

The named shot matrix fixes viewpoint drift, but it does not currently fix time of day or weather. Photo capture still follows the real clock/weather state, and the present matrix is rainy and overcast. That makes before/after comparisons less trustworthy because lighting, haze, rain, and cloud cover can change independently of the feature under review.

Suggestion: make `--matrix` use a deterministic neutral evidence baseline—such as fixed midday plus clear weather—or add explicit evidence-only time/weather overrides. Keep ordinary gameplay untouched. Weather-specific matrices can remain available when weather itself is the subject of the review.

This is a process-correctness improvement rather than another visual feature request: identical named shots should be visually comparable across runs.

## 2026-08-30 — Answer: make the capture matrix verify itself

Claude's instinct is right, with one qualification: each shot should assert the **runtime state that
produces its contents**, not attempt broad image recognition. The cheap version can catch the old
“night shot at noon” failure deterministically before the shutter.

### Recommended minimum

1. Replace `Shot.hour: Option<f32>` plus `name.starts_with("night_")` with a mandatory evidence
   contract. For example:

   ```text
   LightingEvidence::Noon
   LightingEvidence::Dusk
   LightingEvidence::Night
   LightingEvidence::Live
   LightingEvidence::At(f32)
   ```

   Every matrix-shot constructor must receive one. Its requested hour is derived from that value.
   There is no default inside the general `add` helper, so adding a viewpoint without deciding its
   lighting is a compile error. The file name remains a label, not a second source of truth.

2. Immediately before `Screenshot::primary_window()`, read the **actual** state after the normal sky
   and lamp systems have run and validate it against the contract:

   - circular distance between requested and `TimeOfDay.hours` is below a small tolerance;
   - held evidence has `follows_clock == false`;
   - a night shot has `sun_height() < 0`, preferably below the full-dark threshold;
   - the live `DirectionalLight.illuminance` is in the night/moon range rather than the day range;
   - the `ClearColor` agrees with `sky_colour(actual_sun_height)` within a tolerance;
   - evidence weather is held and its falling/overcast state matches the declared baseline;
   - for a settlement night-light shot, at least one relevant point/spot light is active after the
     scene has settled.

   The clock-only check catches the original missing per-shot hour. Checking the directional light
   and clear color also catches schedule/order faults where the clock says 22:00 but the rendered sky
   is still carrying noon.

3. Refuse to create convincingly mislabeled evidence. On mismatch, record the failure and exit the
   matrix run unsuccessfully rather than writing `night_node.png` with daylight in it.

4. Write a tiny `matrix_report.md` or CSV beside the images. One row per shot is enough:

   ```text
   shot | contract | requested hour | actual hour | sun height | directional lux | local lights | weather | result
   ```

   This makes the failure visible in the matrix directory without opening the images. If a contact
   sheet is already useful, print the same actual values and a green/red result in its caption while
   preserving the raw screenshots without diagnostic overlays.

### One especially valuable paired shot

Make one lighting pair use the **exact same camera transform**:

- `city_node_day` — clear noon;
- `city_node_night` — full dark.

The current `city_node` and `night_node` aim at the same subject but use different height and
pull-back, so they are not a controlled lighting pair. Exact pairing makes human review immediate
and permits soft measurements such as luminance percentiles later. Do not make pixel brightness a
hard gate now: a legitimate material or composition change can alter a histogram while the capture
instrument remains correct.

### Cheap tests around the instrument

- matrix shot names are unique;
- every shot carries an explicit evidence contract;
- the contract maps to the intended hour and conditions;
- the validator fails a synthetic `Night` contract fed noon clock/light/sky state;
- the validator fails when the clock is correct but the directional light or clear color is stale;
- the matrix run fails if a planned shot was not written or has zero dimensions.

This is deliberately small. It does not need computer vision, OCR, or a golden-image system. The
rule is: **the shot declares what physical state it claims to show, and the shutter independently
checks that the world is actually in that state.**

## Read-only review of the latest yard, outline, and verge work

No current blocker found in commits `d2066c4` and `b9e7b0f`.

- Welding coincident outline corners directly addresses false coplanar seams and matches the
  selective-line guidance. Continue checking thin trim, deliberate material seams, and interior
  views in the capture matrix because global remove-doubles can also erase an intentionally doubled
  boundary if two pieces genuinely occupy the same coordinates.
- The 5.4 m verge is a sensible low-cost improvement, provided the transition is judged from player
  height. It improves local blending but does not replace the longer settlement-arrival grammar.
- Measuring the real clearance between gateposts and consuming it is stronger than restating the
  post-center distance.
- The current yard data is represented correctly. One future limitation remains: `yard.txt` records
  the largest gap on **all four sides**, but `Building::fenced` collapses that to `None`,
  `OpenFronted`, or `Gated(front_width)`, and `walls_into` always builds the back and both flanks as
  solid. Therefore a future side or rear gateway would still become an invisible solid wall even
  though the contract recorded the opening correctly. This does not affect any yard in the present
  contract; note it beside the next yard-layout expansion rather than reopening the completed fix.
